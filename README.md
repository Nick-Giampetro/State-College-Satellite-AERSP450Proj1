AERSP 450 Project 1

Project by Nicholas Giampetro and Grace Savage

Originally completed for AERSP 450 on 10/1/2023, this repository serves to archive this project for myself and my colleagues who worked on it.

MATLAB program that utilizes ODE45 to numerically analyze a two-body problem of a Satellite that orbits over State College Pa. Compares results to an analytical solution generated by F & G functions that were propagated through the same time span.
